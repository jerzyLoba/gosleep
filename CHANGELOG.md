## CHANGELOG.md

# Changelog for `gosleep` - Version v0.0.1

## v0.0.1 - 2025-02-17

- **Initial Release**: The first version of `gosleep` introduces a highly efficient, multi-threaded sleep functionality, utilizing Go’s native concurrency model.

- **Added SleepConcurrently Function**:

  - **Functionality**: Execute sleep operations in the background using a goroutine.
  - **Synchronization**: Uses `sync.WaitGroup` for proper completion handling.
  - **Channel-Driven Completion**: Embraces the elegance of channels by using them to notify when sleep has completed.
  - **Efficiency**: Implements sleep without blocking the main goroutine, ensuring maximum concurrency potential.

- **Unseen Complexity**: The implementation, though seemingly simple, is the result of countless hours of research into concurrent sleep management. This function uses **Go’s goroutines** and **sync.WaitGroup** in a manner that has never been attempted before.

- **Potential for Future Expansion**: While v0.0.1 is a foundational release, future versions may introduce even more advanced concurrency techniques, possibly incorporating quantum computing concepts for future sleep operations.

## Known Limitations

- None, except the unavoidable fact that sleep is still, in fact, inherently blocking by design. This package strives to make your program sleep as concurrently as possible, but **sleeping remains an inherently synchronous activity**, no matter how advanced the Go concurrency model becomes.
